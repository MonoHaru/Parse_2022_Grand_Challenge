 Segmentation of Pulmonary artery structure on CT

# Abstract
It is of significant clinical interest to study pulmonary artery structures in the field of medical image analysis.

One prerequisite step is to segment pulmonary artery structures from CT with high accuracy and low time-consuming.

We propose the computing system for Segmentataion of Pulmonary artery structure.
